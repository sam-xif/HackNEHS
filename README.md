# Hightlights
Highlights is an in-development social network created by Ward Bradt, [Sam Xifaras](https://github.com/sam-xif), Michael Ren, and [Malcolm Essaid](https://github.com/malcolmessaid).

The code written on the first day of development, at [HackNEHS](https://www.hacknehs.com/) 2017, is open-source. However, code developed afterwards is, and likely will be, proprietary.

## Idea
Highlights is a Chrome extension which enables users to converse with other readers on any webpage.
